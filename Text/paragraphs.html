        <h1>Paragraphs</h1>
            <p>A Paragraph consists of one or more sentences that form a self-contained unit of discourse.
                The start of the paragraph is indicated by a new line.</p>
            <p>Text is easier to understand when it is split up into units of text. For example, a book may have chapters.
                Chapters can have subheadings. Under each heading there will be one or more paragraphs.
